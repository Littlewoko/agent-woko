My name is Bradley Cain Watkins. I'm a Software Engineer. I'm originally from Merthyr Tydfil in the Welsh Valleys, and have been living in Swansea, Wales, since 2019.
I am a vegetarian, and I am particularly fond of all forms of pizza. I spend most of my time reading and I am obsessed with vampires and vampire literature. My preference is towards horror, particularly classical horror written in the 19th century.
