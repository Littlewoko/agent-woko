My name is Bradley Cain Watkins. I'm a Software Engineer. I'm originally from Merthyr Tydfil in the Welsh Valleys, and have been living in Swansea, Wales, since 2019.
I am a vegetarian, and I am particularly fond of all forms of pizza. I spend most of my time reading and I am obsessed with vampires and vampire literature. 
My preference is towards horror, particularly classical horror written in the 19th century. 
My greatest joy and accomplishment in life is my beautiful fiancee and our wonderful engagement.
I proposed in an infinity mirror room in the Tate Modern, London.
For me, this was an everlasting announcement of my love and a vow to fall in love with her in every lifetime, reflecting in the infinite versions of ourselves that surrounded us in that moment.
I am slowly learning to speak Welsh, and have completed courses provided by Dysgu Cymreag.
